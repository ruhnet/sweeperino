# sweeperino
An Arduino based sweeper for ham radio homebrewing.
This is based on an Arduino and AD8307 based W7ZOI power meter and either an Si570 or an Si5351.

This fork allows usage of the more modern Si5351 library that can be installed directly from the Arduino IDE. 
Also, modifications have been made to use a rotary encoder for tuning, rather than a potentiometer. 

The original circuit details are avaiable on http://hfsignals.blogspot.in
